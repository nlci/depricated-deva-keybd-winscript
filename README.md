#Winscript Devanagari Keyboard

This is the Keyman Unicode Keyboard for Devanagiri. This Keyboard works in the same way as it was working in Winscript. However since most users are familiar with InKey layout, we will modify this keyboard to match with WinScript InKey layout.

In the current version there are some things which you have to remember while you are using this keyboard. 

* This keyboard gives all the Devanagiri Vowels, Consonants, Vowel Signs, Diacritical Marks, Devanagiri Numbers , Arabic Numbers and some additional symbols.
* Half Consonants are obtained by pressing 'x' is  after any Consonant.
* Vowel Symbols (matras), Diacritical marks, and Nukta are obtained when a Vowel Letter, Diacritical Letters ( S,H,M), or the letter 'f' is pressed respectively after the consonant.
* Extended Font of any particular double consonant is obtained by pressing 'X' just after the first consonant.
* Inorder to obtain Arabic Numbers please turn Num Lock on.
* Inorder to obtain independent Vowel signs (matras) please press '=' and a single space and the corresponding Vowel letter.

#### Please remember that many of the above will get changed in the final release.
